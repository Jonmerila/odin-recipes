This will be my first project The Odin Project website.

My expectations are that I will learn alot about doing a fullstack project by myself.
I have not read about any guides as of what kind of project I will be doing, but I'm excited to learn.
When this project is over I hope that I will have gained more confidence in doing my own projects and that I will be more self-going.
